A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

### the MaterialApp widget acts as the master plan for the entire application. It sets up global configurations like themes, navigation, and overall structure for the app. Regardless of how many pages (like login, register, homepage, etc.) your app has, they all live under the umbrella of MaterialApp.

### The MaterialApp widget acts as the entry point for managing navigation between different pages and applying consistent styles across the app.
